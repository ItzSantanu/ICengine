# IC Engine AutoCAD Project

## Overview

This repository contains the AutoCAD project files for the assembly diagram of a 100cc single-cylinder Internal Combustion (IC) engine. This project was completed as part of an industrial internship at Ardent Computech Pvt. Ltd., in partial fulfillment for the award of the B.Tech degree in the Mechanical Department of Dr. B.C. Roy Engineering College.

## Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to learn and apply AutoCAD 2D and 3D drawing skills to create detailed diagrams of the components of an IC engine. The training involved understanding how to create basic 2D drawings and gradually move on to more complex 3D drawings using AutoCAD software.

## Features

- **Detailed Component Drawings:** Each part of the 100cc single-cylinder IC engine is drawn with precise dimensions and specifications.
- **Comprehensive Assembly:** The project provides a complete assembly diagram of the IC engine, showing how each component fits together.
- **Educational Value:** The project serves as a practical application of theoretical knowledge in mechanical engineering and CAD design.

## Components

The IC engine model includes the following parts:

1. Cam Shaft
2. Cam Sprocket
3. Gudgeon Pin
4. Circlip
5. Connecting Rod
6. Exhaust Valve
7. Inlet Valve
8. Spring
9. Piston Ring
10. Piston
11. Gasket
12. Gear Nut
13. Crank Nut
14. Rocker Arm
15. Driving Gear
16. Crank Flywheel
17. Crankshaft
18. Spark Plug

## Advantages of IC Engine

- High overall efficiency
- Low weight-to-power ratio
- Low initial cost
- Easy to start even in cold conditions
- Requires less space due to compact size
- Mechanical simplicity

## Applications of IC Engine

- Vehicles (scooters, buses, etc.)
- Aircrafts
- Construction equipment (bulldozers, power shovels, etc.)
- Industrial machinery
- Locomotives
- Pumping sets

## Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites

- AutoCAD software installed on your computer.

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ItzSantanu/ICengine.git
    cd ICengine
    ```

2. Open the AutoCAD files (.dwg) using AutoCAD software.

3. Review and interact with the 2D and 3D drawings to understand the assembly and components of the IC engine.
